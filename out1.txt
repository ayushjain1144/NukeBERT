the contract with the usaec for the large fast reactor design study was signed
june  with an effective date of june  and a termination date of december ,
 work was started midjune and has continued in accordance with the preliminary work plan submitted to the chicago operations office letters of intent
to enter in a subcontract have been sent to atomic power development associates
and babcock and wilcox, and allischalmers is presently preparing the subcontracts
the physics and safety analysis tasks have been assigned to apda and one physicist
from allischalmers and two physicists from babcock and wilcox have been assigned
to work at apda and are now in detroit working on the project
several meetings have been held to orient work on the project
a _ a meeting was attended at chicago operations office on july
 to discuss ground rules for the study that would limit the scope
of the studies to the areas of particular interest to the aec and
make the basis of the four individual studies consistent so that
comparison of the results may be more readily made
b _ a meeting of the advisory committee and project manager was
held at ac in washington on july  to establish basic criteria
for the study and discuss reactor configurations that meet the
criteria work for the following month was scoped
c _ a meeting was held at apda in detroit on july  with
physics personnel to discuss the basic areas of interest for
the study and to review the calculational techniques that
will be used
d _ a meeting was held at ac in washington on july  to discuss the
results of preliminary physics calculations and fuel element design
considerations earlier objectives were reevaluated and work
was oriented accordingly
the project organization for the study will be as shown on the attached chart
work under the various lead engineers will be performed by members of their organiza
tion or by loaned employees of the associated companies monthly cost reports
will be made separately
 technical
 design criteria
the following design criteria have been established for the studya _ complete reliance on the doppler coefficient for reactor safety
is to be avoided major emphasis will be placed on attempting
to obtain a sodium coefficient which is negative or not significantly different from 
b no large positive reactivity coefficient from fuel movement will
be permitted this will be accomplished by segmenting or other
mechanical fuel design provisions
c the fuel will be designed for high burnup ,  ,
mwd/mt
d the use of a gas reservoir out of the core will be avoided if
possible
e _ a fuel management program using an annual refueling shutdown
is a design target 
f the refueling mechanism will be brought into the reactor vessel
for refueling only mechanisms inside the reactor vessel will be
avoided where possible
 core concepts
a number of techniques for achieving a negative sodium coefficient have been
identified and those which will be investigated first are  high leakage cores,
 moving fuel to a less reactive configuration by thermally initiated means in
studying the high leakage core approach two problems which require special attention
are  providing sufficient control to permit high burnup with the reduced internal
conversion ratios obtained in high leakage cores  proper blanket design to achieve
the required overall breeding gain
when preliminary designs of the fuel assemblies have been completed, means of
achieving fuel movement through a thermomechanical design approach will be
studied
in addition to minimizing fuel slumping effects by segmenting the axial fuel elements,
a crossflow subassembly design is being considered this approach is especially
attractive from the point of view of remote fuel refabrication
 fuel assembly design
 materials
consistent with the core concepts discussed above, concepts and related calculations
for fuel assemblies have been started the designated plutoniumuranium mixed oxidefuel with stainless steel cladding is being used the reference cladding material
chosen is  ss with an alternate material,  dl, being considered because of
its superior high temperature creep properties
 mechanical analzsis
in order to establish metallurgical and mechanical limitations of fuel pins a series
of calculations have been initiated
equations to obtain the burnup rate, cladding final stress corresponding to % creep
and metallurgical lifetime of fuel element were derived as a function of the following
parameters pin diameter, relative cladding thickness, fuel void, fraction of gas
released and heat generation rate
fuel lifetimes were calculated for  stainless steel at  and  f cladding
temperatures and various values of the parameters listed above results were set in
tabulated form and similar calculations will be made in the near future using  dl
steel in addition to the  ss
work is continuing and results will be shown graphically to allow a more ready
identification of trends caused by change in individual parameters
 thermal analysis
consideration was given to tubular fuel elements versus pins having an equivalent
core central temperature fde =  btu/hrft for initial thermal analysis the
tubular elements were eliminated due to structural weakness for containment of the
fission gas
preliminary hydraulic analysis has been performed on various core fuel assemblies
with fuel pin diameters ranging from  in to  in in all cases, constant
reference values were used for linear heat generation q/l max, sodium temperature
difference across the core  f, core height  ft, and pitch of the spacer systems
both square and hexagonal can assemblies have been considered, with square and
triangular double grid spacers and spiral wire spacers the volume fractions of sodium,
fuel, void, and steel structure have been varied to determine compositions which are
suitable from the hydraulic standpoint an initial reference composition has been
selected for physics analysis
 mechanical design
preliminary drawings of the segmented fuel square array fuel assembly and the
crossflow fuel assembly are practically complete a preliminary layout of the square
array core is also being prepared for use in control and fuel handling mechanism
concept studies physics
preliminary analysis to determine the sodium void coefficient for large cores has been
started extrapolating the results of previous fast reactor studies, a core size and
composition were selected a  liter cylindrical core with an l/d =  and with
an outer blanket is the reference for comparison with cores where the blanket material
and core are arranged to provide for increased leakage thin inner annular blankets
do not appear to significantly effect the sodium coefficient but thicker blankets do
these calculations are being refined problems are being set up for annular cores
of various thickness and cores with a central axial blanket region
